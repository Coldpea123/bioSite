                <h2>Hobbies</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>I enjoy playing video games. I play a wide variety of games but mostly multiplayer games such as MOBAs and MMORPGs. I mostly play on my PC and phone.</li>
                    <li>I like to play tennis when I can. I've been playing since High School and like to go to the courts once in a while.</li>
                    <li>I watch anime to relax and kill time a lot of nights. It's a good way to unwind and watch cool animated fights!</li>
                    <li>I drink coffee nearly every day, I'm a bit afraid to see how much in total I've spent on coffee haha! I used to frequent Starbucks but now I go to Dutch Bros every morning. I typically like drinks that are strong but also not too bitter.</li>
                    <li>Spending time with my dog is one thing I look forward to the most each day! Nova is a delight and I treat him as if he's my own child!</li>
